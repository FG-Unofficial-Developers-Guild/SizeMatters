# Size Matters
Adds support for effects that change creature size, space, and reach.

**SIZE: n** - Adjusts the bearer n number of size increments. E.g. "SIZE: 2" will turn a small creature into a large creature.
**SIZE: size** - Makes the bearer the given size. The allowed values for size are determined by the ruleset (for any ruleset that uses "DataCommon.creaturesize").
**SPACE: n** - Sets the bearer's space to n, using the ruleset's unit of distance.
**ADDSPACE: n** - Adds n to the bearer's reach, using the ruleset's unit of distance.
**REACH: n** - Sets the bearer's reach to n, using the ruleset's unit of distance.
**ADDREACH: n** - Adds n to the bearer's reach, using the ruleset's unit of distance.
